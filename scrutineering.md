# Scrutineering

Before they can get on the track or road, teams and their cars undergo several days of scrutiny from the event's technical staff. Teams will go through up to 12 of the following stations depending on their vehicle class and the competitions they are participating in.
<table style="font-size:15px">
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Driver Registration</b></td>
    <td>At this station teams register their drivers (and passengers for MOV). They are checked for a valid license, allowable helmets, safe shoes, and weigh in for ballast.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Driver Operations</b></td>
    <td>Here drivers (and passengers for MOV) are checked to ensure they fit in the car, have the proper equipment in the car (water, radio, ballast holder), and that they can egress the car in under 10 seconds.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Lights &amp; Vision</b></td>
    <td>Lights &amp; Vision ensures that drivers have the required field of view from the solar vehicle, including rear vision, and that the vehicle lights are visible and bright. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Body &amp; Sizing</b></td>
    <td>This station ensures that the size and configuration of the vehicles is within regulations including: overall size, solar array size, seat belts, headrests, signage, weight, &amp; more. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Electrical</b></td>
    <td>The electrical station verifies that a car electrical system meets all safety requirements and competitive requirements including battery size. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Battery Protection</b></td>
    <td>At this stations teams' batteries undergo tests to ensure the battery is only operated within safe ranges for voltage, current, and temperature. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Mechanical </b></td>
    <td>Here vehicles undergo a thorough inspection of their body, chassis, roll-cage, brakes, steering, and suspension to ensure they meet safety and competitive regulations.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Dynamics</b></td>
    <td>At dynamics cars and driver must pass U-Turn, Figure-8, Slalom, and Braking Tests with the requisite performance</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Array Testing</b></td>
    <td>At this station the vehicles solar array is tested and verified</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Safety</b></td>
    <td>The Safety Check verifies that teams have the required safety equipment for solar car racing including fire extinguishers, first aid kits, and more. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Support</b></td>
    <td>This station checks that support vehicles have the required safety equipment for ASC.<br> (Teams not participating in ASC skip this station)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>MOV</b></td>
    <td>Multi-Occupant Vehicles are checked for compatibility with required charging and metering equipment. <br>(SOV Teams skip this station) <i><a href="https://www.americansolarchallenge.org/the-competition/vehicle-classes/">Learn More About the Vehicle Classes</a></i></td>
